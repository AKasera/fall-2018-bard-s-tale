Hey y'all- feel free to update you art in this folder, if that's convenient, but DEFINITELY update you art in BardsTale/Assets/Resources/Sprites! If you don't, we won't be able to use your art in-game! Additionally, the more .gif or .png files we can use, the better- .ase files are hard to import into the game.

Thanks!
